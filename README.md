Two Sum Problem (Java)

This project contains a simple Java implementation of the classic Two Sum Problem.
The program finds two indices in an array such that the numbers at those indices add up to a specified target value.

📌 Problem Statement

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Example:
Input:

nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9

Output:

Indices: [0, 1]
Values: 2 + 7 = 9

🛠️ Implementation Details
Uses a HashMap for efficient lookups.
Runs in O(n) time complexity with O(n) space complexity.
Returns the indices as an array of size 2.
